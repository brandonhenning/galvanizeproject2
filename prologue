Twenty years ago…

By all appearances it was a normal evening on this Baltimore suburban street. Like most summer nights the hot and humid afternoon had ushered in storm clouds by evening and by late night a torrential downpour punished the pavement and sidewalks. The wind whipped the trees into a frenzy and the rain fell in waves from the sky.  

The rows of small houses that lined the street all looked alike. The only difference that separated one from the next was the different color of beige it had been painted. It was a trash night and the street was lined with silver metallic trash cans that stood proudly in the street in front of the beige house each represented. 
The wind whipped so hard now that leaves piled up occasionally against the trash cans where they could find shelter. 
There was not a soul in sight. 

Most of the completely ordinary people that occupied these identical houses lived nearly identical lives. That day they had all woken up and eaten their bowl of cereal while reading their newspaper. They had all backed out of their garages on their way to work at the same time. When their work days were over they had all fought the same rush hour traffic and had scrambled home to open their garage doors and enter their little huts. Once safely inside, they had eaten their dinner, watched their television shows, complained about their local politicians, brushed their teeth, and then finally had gone to sleep. Now they were snoring. Nothing ever happened on this street. 

But tonight was not a normal summer evening. If anyone had been awake they might have seen the lone slim figure stumbling up the deserted street. 

A dark cloak clung to the body as the rain and wind whipped against its back. It cradled something with both arms and hid it inside its cloak. It was hunched over and tried to walk in a straight line down the middle of the street. 
Each step up the street looked more and more difficult. The figure slipped to one knee and nearly knocked over one of the metallic trash cans on the side of the road. It paused then righted itself and continued down the street. 

The lightning cracked across the sky temporarily casting a white light onto the asphalt street surface. If anyone had been around they would have noticed the small trickle of blood trailing the cloaked figure and mixing with the stream of rain water rushing down the street. 

The figure came to a stop in the middle of the road. Its breathing was labored. It turned slowly to face the house numbered 1110. This house was the same as all of the other houses on the street. The young married couple inside were fast asleep, dreaming of corporate promotions and home improvement projects. 

The cloaked figure held its precious bundle with one hand and used its other to slowly remove its hood. 
The hood fell down to reveal the beautiful features of a fair-haired, middle aged woman. Grey hair stuck to the sides of her face from rain and perspiration. She had bright eyes that had become dark with pain and grief. She was pale and the corners of her mouth barely concealed dry, caked blood. 

She wrapped both arms around the object she carried and took a step towards house number 1110. Her knee buckled and nearly gave out. She took another step. And another. She grimaced with each slow step up the sidewalk and to the front steps of 1110. A pale, bony finger rose slowly from her side to press the doorbell of the house. 
A small, hand-carved, wooden sign hanging on the front door read, “Happy home of the Winslows.” 

She knelt and carefully placed her bundled package on the top step in front of the door. The package let out a small whimper. The woman knelt over the package and her tears mixed with the rain as they fell from her face and landed on top of the little blanket covered bundle. She knelt down and kissed the cloth as the little package let out another whimper and then began to cry softly. 

Muffled bumping and stumbling could be heard from inside the house as the occupants neared the front door. The woman picked herself up off the front porch and stood looking down at her small crying bundle. Tears streamed down her face and mixed with the rain water and blood now gathering underneath her on the top step. She turned for the side of the house and stumbled out of sight as the front door opened. 

The cloaked woman watched from the shadows as the young Winslows realized what was on their front steps and heard the little child cry. An earlier placed phone call assured they would not search for the child’s parents. She watched as Mrs. Winslow picked up her baby and carried it inside and shut the door. 

The cloaked woman rested her back against the side of the house. The rain streamed down her forehead and blurred her vision. Her chest was heaving now. Each breath hurt more than the last. She squinted through the rain and looked up at the sky. 
The primary star of the planet she had come from was not visible through the dark clouds and torrential rain, but she knew it was there. 

She should never have come to this world. 

In her haste to hide her child she had endangered this innocent little planet called Earth. It was only a matter of time before her killers found where she had hidden her son. And then they would come.
